# Accessibility

Project VIC International aims to make the CAC Ontology website usable by as many people as possible.

## What we try to support

- Keyboard navigation (no mouse required)
- Visible focus indicators
- Clear headings and page structure
- Reasonable color contrast
- Accessible embedded media (when enabled)

## Known limitations

Some optional third-party services (for example, embedded media and support widgets) are provided by external vendors and may not meet every accessibility expectation in all environments.

If you encounter an accessibility issue on this site, please contact us:
