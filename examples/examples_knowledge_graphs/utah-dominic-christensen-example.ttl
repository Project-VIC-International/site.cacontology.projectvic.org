# UTAH ICAC – DOMINIC LYNN CHRISTENSEN PRESS RELEASE EXAMPLE
# =============================================================================
#
# ARTICLE MAPPING SUMMARY
# - Offender:
#   - "Dominic Lynn Christensen, 24" -> ex:DominicChristensen (uco-identity:Person,
#     cacontology-registry:RegisteredSexOffender, cacontology-registry:RecidivistSexOffender).
# - Prior 2021 cases (Sanpete County):
#   - May 2021 forcible sexual abuse while 18-year-old victim sleeps -> ex:May2021AssaultEvent
#     (cacontology:ChildSexualAbuseEvent) located in ex:SanpeteCounty and linked to
#     ex:Victim_May2021 (18-year-old) and ex:DominicChristensen.
#   - July 2021 online/offline relationship with 15-year-old and photos with 11-year-old ->
#     ex:July2021GroomingAbuseEvent (cacontology:ChildSexualAbuseEvent) and ex:July2021CSAMIncident
#     (cacontology:CSAMIncident) with multiple juvenile victims.
#   - "playing a game with sexual consequences with several juveniles" -> modeled as
#     ex:SexualConsequenceGameBehavior (cacontology-grooming:PhysicalSpaceGrooming) to reuse
#     existing grooming patterns for offline, multi-victim sexualized games.
#   - Charges "forcible sexual abuse", "sexual exploitation of a minor", "sexual abuse of a child"
#     -> ex:Charge_2021_ForcibleSexualAbuse, ex:Charge_2021_SexualExploitationMinor,
#        ex:Charge_2021_SexualAbuseChild (cacontology-sentencing:StateCharge) with
#        sentencing resources ex:Sentence_2021_Jail and ex:Sentence_2021_Probation
#        capturing 364 days jail and 48 months probation served concurrently.
# - Registry status & compliance:
#   - Article text that he is a "sex offender" and later "facing charges for failure to register or
#     providing false info as a sex offender" -> ex:ChristensenRegistrationRecord
#     (cacontology-registry:RegistrationRecord) and ex:ComplianceViolation_Registration2025
#     (cacontology-registry:ComplianceViolation) linked to ex:DominicChristensen.
# - Current 2025 NCMEC-driven case (Garfield County):
#   - August 21 cybertip where "NCMEC received a tip that a specific user had uploaded child sexual
#     abuse material" -> ex:NCMECReport_2025_08_21 (cacontology-us-ncmec:NCMECCybertipReport) with
#     ex:CyberTipIncident_CSAMOnline (cacontology-us-ncmec:OnlineEnticementIncident) and
#     ex:CSAMIncident_2025 (cacontology:CSAMIncident).
#   - "email address, username, and IP address" -> ex:ChristensenEmailAccount
#     (uco-observable:DigitalAccount), ex:ChristensenIPAddress (uco-observable:ObservableObject
#     with descriptive value), linked via NCMEC AccountLinking pattern.
#   - "search warrant to the email provider" -> ex:LegalProcess_SearchWarrantEmail
#     (uco-action:Action) with rdfs:comment; investigation modeled as ex:ChristensenInvestigation_2025
#     (cacontology:CACInvestigation).
#   - "contents between Christensen’s account and another user... juvenile female" and "CSAM showing
#     adults sexually assaulting children" -> ex:OnlineVictim_2025 (cacontology-grooming:ChildVictim)
#     and ex:CSAMDossier_2025 (uco-observable:DigitalArtifact) linked to the CSAM incident.
#   - New charges "seven counts of sexual exploitation of a minor" in Garfield County and "failure to
#     register or providing false info as a sex offender" -> ex:Charge_2025_SexualExploitationMinor
#     and ex:Charge_2025_RegistrationOffenses (cacontology-sentencing:StateCharge).
#   - "held without bail in Garfield County Jail" and initial appearance set for November 20, 2025 ->
#     captured via rdfs:comment on ex:PretrialDetention_2025 (uco-action:Action) because current
#     sentencing ontology does not yet have explicit bail status modeling.
#
# This example intentionally reuses existing CAC Ontology modules (core, grooming, sentencing,
# sex-offender-registry, US NCMEC) and highlights ontology gaps such as:
# - Lack of explicit failure-to-register / false-information charge classes in registry/sentencing.
# - No dedicated bail / held-without-bail representation.
# - No specialized "sexual consequence game" grooming subtype (approximated with PhysicalSpaceGrooming).
