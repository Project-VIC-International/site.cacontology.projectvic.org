  <h2>Express & Exchange</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Crimes Against Children (CAC) Ontology Family</strong> is a community-developed evolving standard that provides a structured (ontology-based) specification for representing information commonly analyzed and exchanged by people and systems during investigations involving digital evidence related to crimes against children.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power of CAC Ontology is that it provides a common language to support automated normalization, combination and validation of varied information sources to facilitate analysis and exploration of investigative questions (who, when, how long, where). In addition to representing tool results, CAC Ontology ensures that analysis results can be traced back to their source(s), keeping track of when, where and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    CAC Ontology extends the <strong>Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)</strong> and the <strong>Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) Ontology</strong>, providing specialized modules for modeling child exploitation investigations, operations, legal processes, reporting, offender tradecraft, and digital forensics activities.
