  <p>
    The <strong>Crimes Against Children (CAC) Ontology Family</strong> is a community-developed evolving standard that provides a structured (ontology-based) specification for representing information commonly analyzed and exchanged by people and systems during investigations involving digital evidence related to crimes against children.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power of CAC Ontology is that it provides a common language to support automated normalization, combination and validation of varied information sources to facilitate analysis and exploration of investigative questions (who, when, how long, where). In addition to representing tool results, CAC Ontology ensures that analysis results can be traced back to their source(s), keeping track of when, where and who used which tools to perform investigative actions on data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    CAC Ontology extends the <strong>Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)</strong> and the <strong>Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) Ontology</strong>, providing specialized modules for modeling child exploitation investigations, operations, legal processes, reporting, offender tradecraft, and digital forensics activities.

<section class="intro-section" aria-labelledby="about-initiative-heading">
  <h2 id="about-initiative-heading">About the Initiative</h2>
  <p>
    The CAC Ontology is shepherded by <strong>Project VIC International</strong>, but further development of this initiative is open to any participant. The CAC Ontology represents many of the concepts used in spoken and written language globally by government and law enforcement agencies, NGOs, academic organizations, and commercial industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our plan is to continue to evolve this family of ontologies to represent new victim-centric language as it is developed and used across the world. We view the CAC Ontology as a semantic foundation that AI technologies can build upon.
  </p>
  <p>
    We understand that not all language is represented, so we ask persons and organizations to provide concepts, documents, and data that we can reference to improve the CAC Ontology.
