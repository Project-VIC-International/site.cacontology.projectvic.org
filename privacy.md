## Optional third-party services (opt-in)

This site can use optional third-party services. By default, they are **off** until you opt in.

You can change your choices at any time via:

- the “Privacy settings” link in the footer, or
- the consent banner (shown on first visit)

Optional services include:

- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (GA4)
- **Embedded media**: YouTube video embed (privacy-enhanced mode)
- **Support widget**: Zendesk widget

If you decline optional services, the content of the site remains available; those services simply will not load.
